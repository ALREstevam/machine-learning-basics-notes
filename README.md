# machine_learning_basics_notes

Notes about machine learning basics (at least for now...).

In markdown (edited on [Typora](https://typora.io/), so you may have some issues if you're (or me from the future) using other editor).

Eventually converted to html...



Some code examples in:

* GeoGebra
* Python
